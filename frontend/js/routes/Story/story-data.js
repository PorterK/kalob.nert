    was great for it's social enrichment but I can retrospectively say that the biggest impact it had on my life was
    in a little feature where they allowed you to edit the layout of your profile. Here is where I learned the basics
    of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At this time I didn't know how far that knowledge would carry me.

    body: `
      In early 2011 I discovered a little indie game called Minecraft. After several hundred hours in single player, and
      even more in multiplayer, I wanted to start my own server. This endeavor is where I learned the basics of network
      communication, the bash command line, and many other valuable skills. The real learning, however, came when I wanted
      to create my own multiplayer plugins to customize my server. At the time Bukkit was the leading open source multiplayer
      server for Minecraft and it had an API with decent documentation. This is where I learned Java, object oriented programming,
      and started digging deep into algorithms and the complicated math around player position and monster movement. Throughout
      high school, I continued learning and developing my skills in Java.

    employee had a little shed on wheels that could be moved around to accomidate ever-changing teams, projects, etc. At DeveloperTown
    I met Jon Nolen, who I would look to as a teacher and mentor for the years to come. I showed off some of my Java code, took an NDA home
    to my parents, and started my very first javascript project in Angular. For the next few months I would continue as an unpaid intern,
    until offered a job as a paid intern early in the summer. I worked at DeveloperTown full time until May of 2017.

    called DT Starts. This company would look back on the roots of DeveloperTown and work with startups to trade hours for equity and exist as the
    techincal co-founder. I got to know a few of the employees of DeveloperTown who had moved to DT Starts and I asked for a transfer. DeveloperTown was happy
    to oblige. After working there for a couple of months I ended up securing a spot as a full time software engineer. At this time I dropped out of college 
    to persue a career doing startups. This is where I have leveled up the most in my career. I started in React but was quickly asked to expand my knowledge to other
    parts of the technology. I spent extended lengths of time working in Node.js, doing Dev Ops, working with co-founders to make architectual decisions, creating
    several data models, and even architecting entire systems that are in production today.
